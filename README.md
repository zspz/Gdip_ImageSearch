# Gdip_ImageSearch
This repository contains a fork of MasterFocus's [Gdip_ImageSearch](https://github.com/MasterFocus/AutoHotkey/tree/master/Functions/Gdip_ImageSearch) library changed to be compatible with [AutoHotkey v2](https://autohotkey.com/v2/).

All credit goes to MasterFocus and the contributors of the original Gdip_ImageSearch function.

## Usage
All functions use the same parameters as before. TestScript.ahk has been updated as an example.
